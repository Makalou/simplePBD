 ## Build & Run
 This project uses CMake as build system. Please ensure that CMake has been installed firstly before building.
 
 Under the project root path, open terminal and enter
 ```bash
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 ```
 Then CMake should automatically check dependencies and generate platform-specific project manage file : (e.g. .sln on Windows).
 You can then open the project within your favorite IDE then build and run.
